# Privacy-preserving machine learning
Data privacy is a huge concern and often prevents ML and AI project from flourishing.

In this talk we’ll introduce you to federated learning and homomorphic encryption. After we’ve covered the theoretical aspects we’ll see
how they can be used in practice. 

We conclude with an outlook on the future of these technologies.

# The Open ML and AI DevOps toolsuite of the future
 
In 2019 we've noticed a tremendous shift of client demand on model creation to model deployment and monitoring. This indicates a further step towards maturity of wider AI adoption within enterprises. In this talk we'll introduce you to the latest developments in the most widely used DeepLearning framework TensorFlow 2.1. We show how Kubernetes and Kubeflow Pipelines work and how Open Data Hub provides a Open Source powered platform for data science. Finally, we show you an end to end project example of a product using all of those components in harmony.
